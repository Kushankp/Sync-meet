Project Description
This project is a web application that allows users to share their Google Calendar data using a QR code. One user generates a QR code containing a unique session ID, 
which can be shared with others. When someone scans the QR code, they are prompted to authenticate via Google OAuth 2.0 and grant access to their Google Calendar. 
The calendar data is then automatically fetched and shared with the original user for scheduling and event planning purposes.

Key Features (Planned)
QR Code Sharing: Generate a QR code that contains a unique session ID.
OAuth 2.0 Integration: Authenticate users via Google and request access to their Google Calendar.
Google Calendar API Integration: Fetch and share calendar data after authentication.
Automatic Data Collection: No manual action required after scanning the QR code; the process is automated.
